Don’t doubt the celestial support you are blessed with. Just because things are not manifesting as per the timeline you have in mind, doesn’t mean they won’t eventually. Instead of getting entangled in a web of “hows” and “why”, visualise a positive outcome and trust that you’re being propelled in the direction of the desired destination. Updating and/or revisiting your vision board is also recommended at this moment!"

What Spirit is urging you to do right now is: adopt the spirit of selfless service as you drop your attachments to a certain outcome. That said, some of you may feel the urge to connect with your philanthropic side. Pay attention to cause(s) you’re being called to support as you remember that contribution is too small."

You already know the answer to this one, beautiful! Just for today, let go of your resistance, your false sense of control, and let the flow take you where you need to go. As you do, remember that every prayer is essentially a two-way dialogue with the Universe. So, ask for what you need and then allow yourself to receive guidance through the whispers of your soul. Just a reminder: You are held and protected in more ways than you can count.            "

What’s in: listening to your heart and letting your inner GPS lead the way. What’s out: letting the opinions of others weigh you down. As such, things on the love and romance front promise to be lit in the days to come. Don’t be in a rush to take things to the next level or put a label on your relationship, though. Now is the time to explore the length and breadth of this connection as you toss every rulebook out of the window."

Who says you don’t have direct access to the celestial forces or that you cannot manifest a slice of paradise exactly where you are, beautiful? Today, instead of looking at meditation as an elusive goal, think of every task at hand as meditation in motion. Whether you’re brewing tea, making art or perfecting that presentation, pour the intention of grace and gratitude into your work. That said, connecting with nature and the elements will also enable you to invite more peace and tranquillity into your experience."

Overheard at the cosmic conference: this chapter of your life is about healing and growing alongside each other. ‘Course that doesn’t mean everything is going to be picture-perfect in your world. Conflicting situations may arise, as they often do. The key? Learning to navigate sticky situations with a brave and open heart as you assess both sides of the story.            "

So, you’re giving yourself the permission to rewrite the narrative and trust where your inner compass is leading you towards, now and in every moment.

Word for the wise: give yourself the permission to grieve what was and what could have been as you lean on your spirit guides for support. That said, you’re also being asked to prioritise your health. To make decisions that support your well-being. Start by making minor adjustments in your daily routine. How about waking up an hour earlier each and every day?"

Think of this as a time of introspection. A time of looking inwards, clearing the false programming, embracing your truth and showing up as your most authentic self. Here’s the thing about inner work: it never gets applauded publicly, and that’s okay. The only thing that matters right now is that *you* are willing to show up for yourself."
